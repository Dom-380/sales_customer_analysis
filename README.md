# üìä Python Portfolio ‚Äì Customer and Sales Analysis

Hello there! This repository features a series of python-based data analysis projects investigating sales trends and customer demographics. Each project leverages real-world dataset to demonstrate my skills in data organization, visualization, modeling and interpretaion. This portfolio highlights my ability to uncover key insights from complex data, driving strong data-informed decisions.

## üîπ Video Game Sales Analysis

This project dives into 40 years of video game sales data using Python. The goals were to identify sales trends, clean inconsistent data, and uncover patterns across platforms and time.

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV dataset (public)

### Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed historical video game data
- Filtered and aggregated key metrics for trend analysis
- Collaborated on peer reviews to validate findings and troubleshoot issues

### Dataset
This analysis uses the [Video Game Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings).  
Please download the CSV and place it in the `/data` folder to reproduce results.


## üîπ Bank Churn Analysis

This project examines demographic features of bank customers to identify trends and predict the likelihood of churn (their decision to leave the bank).

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and analysis
- Scikit-learn for logistic regression modeling and evaluation
- CSV dataset (public) for real-world data analysis

### Key Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover statistical trends of bank customers
- Utilized data visualization to further highlight key findings
- Employed and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict customer churn

### Dataset
This analysis uses the 'Bank_Churn' dataset in my GitHub repository found here https://github.com/Dom-380/sales_customer_analysis/tree/main/data.
Please download the CSV and place it in the `/data` folder to reproduce results.
